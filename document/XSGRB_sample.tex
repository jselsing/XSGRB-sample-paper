	\section{Results}
	
	\subsection{Spectral resolution}
	The afterglow spectra described in this paper are obtained in
	Target-of-Opportunity (override) mode.
	In most cases there is therefore little possibility to tweak slit widths to the
	seeing at the time of observations (i.e. to optimise spectral resolution and
	signal to noise), and almost all our data is therefore taken with a fixed set
	of slit widths and binning, described above.
	In a fair number of cases, the seeing full width at half maximum (FWHM) is
	considerably smaller than the silt width, and the delivered spectral resolution
	will then be determined by the seeing rather than slit width, as afterglows are
	point sources (this is evidently not the case for extended sources, e.g for
	host galaxies).
	The delivered resolution for slit width dominated spectra post-reduction and
	extraction can easily be determined from the bright sky emission lines.
	For afterglow spectra with very high signal to noise, the delivered spectral
	resolution can at times be determined from the science data themselves.
	However, in the presence of multiple velocity components in absorption, other
	forms of line broadening, and a lack of lines at some redshifts, this is
	difficult to do at poorer signal to noise ratios (the majority of spectra in
	our sample).
	A broad starting value for the expect resolution will help fitting of these
	spectra, and can be important in upper limit determination, and for this reason
	we construct a aim to construct a crude relation between the seeing and the
	delivered resolution at our slit width, binning, and reduction pipeline
	settings.
	To this end we use observations of telluric standard stars that are taken with
	identical instrument settings as our afterglow spectra, usually just after the
	science data, as part of the ESO X-shooter calibration plan.
	These spectra have been reduced together with the afterglow spectra, using
	identical pipeline settings with the same version of the pipeline.
	First we fit a Gaussian function in the spatial direction of the trace of the
	standard star at 792 nm (i.e. in the VIS arm).
	After this, we fit a series of  20 telluric absorption lines in the telluric
	standard star spectra with Gaussians, taking care to select transitions that
	are not almost-resolved multiples, should be intrinsically unresolved, and are
	in areas with well defined continuum flux.
	We pick 34 telluric standard stars spanning a range of DIMM seeing values, with
	the majority between $0.5-1.5 arcsec$.
	The resulting distribution of spectral FWHM (km/s) as a function of spatial
	FWHM at 792 nm is fairly well described by a linear relation $a + b*x$, with
	$x$ the spatial FWHM in pixels (with 0.15 arc sec per pixel),  $a= 21.4 \pm
	1.3$ km/s, $b=1.4 \pm 0.2$.
	We use this linear relation as a way to estimate the spectral resolution for
	medium to poor signal to noise afterglow spectra in the VIS arm.
	To extend this to the UVB and NIR arm, we measured a series of lines in NIR arm
	spectra of a subset of 19 sources used for the VIS arm above, and find that the
	resulting distribution is consistent with a simple scaling of the VIS arm
	relation by the ratio of resolutions of the NIR and VIS arm for unresolved,
	slit filling, sources as given on the ESO instrument website.
	The UVB arm contains no suitable absorption lines to use, and we therefore use
	a scaled value as in the NIR arm.
	While this simple method is not terribly accurate (for one, the spatial profile
	of the trace is not a perfect Gaussian), but it gives a sufficiently accurate
	estimate for the analysis of these poor signal to noise science spectra.

	\subsection{Correction for offsets in the wavelength calibration}    
	
	X-shooter, being installed at the VLT Cassegrain focusi is  prone to
	flexures during operations. The flexures modify the projection of the slit
	on the detector with respect to the one obtained in daytime calibration. 
	This require a modification of the wavelength solution in order to
	process correctly the night-time data. Part of this correction
	is performed by the pipeline using the frames taken
	during X-shooter Active Flexure Compensation procedure
	\footnote{X-shooter User Manual available at https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/xshooter/doc.html}
	We corrected the remaining part using as a reference the sky
	emission lines present in the observed data.
	
	
	For every afterglow observation we reduced one frame individually in STARE mode without
	sky subtraction obtaining $\sim$ 100 sky spectra. The sky line list compiled at ESO for
	the E-ELT
	study\footnote{http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/science/drm/tech\_data/data/optical\_ir\_sky\_lines.dat}
	from the work of (Hanuschik, 2003, A\&A, 407, 1157) and (Rousselot et al. (2000, A\&A, 354, 1134), was used as a reference.
	From this list, we selected a subset of bright and isolated lines. In the case of the OH doublets, unresolved at X-shooter resolution, we took as line position the average between the blue and red components. To find the offsets of the spectra, we fitted gaussians near the
	expected positions under IDL using the MPFIT software (Markwardt, 2009, Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series, Vol. 411, ADASS XVII, ed. D.A. Bohlender, D. Durand, \& P. Dowler, 251) and we compared the result to the tabulated values.
	The resulting offsets, which were smaller than 0.1 \AA~in the UVB and VIS data
	and smaller than 0.5 \AA~in the NIR spectra, were applied to the corresponding spectra.

	in 10.8 ks. GRB likely located at high
	redshift\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10399.gcn3}}. The spectrum
	has not otherwise been published previously.
	
	\subsection{GRB100219A (z = 4.667)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#

	those of \lya, from a multitude of ions are detected against the afterglow
	continuum at $z = 4.667$. Additionally, absorption from an intervening system
	is found at $z = 2.181$.
	
	\subsection{GRB100316B (z = 1.180)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	10495\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10495.gcn3}}. The spectrum
	has not otherwise been published previously. Observations started 44 minutes
	after the \textit{Swift} trigger and has a total exposure time of 2.4 ks.
	Absorption features from \feii, \alii, \aliii,	\mgii~and \mgi~are well detected
	against the afterglow continuum at $z = 1.180$. Additionally, strong absorption
	lines from \feii~and \mgii~from an intervening system are found at $z = 1.063$.
	
	\subsection{GRB100316D (z = 0.059)}

	\subsection{GRB100418A (z=0.624)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	10620\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10620.gcn3}} and GCN \#
	10631\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10631.gcn3}} and is published
	in \citet{DeUgartePostigo2011}. The burst have been followed up in three epochs
	of observations, 0.4, 1.4, and 2.4 days after the burst, each lasting 4.8 ks.
	The unambiguous redshift of the host, $z=0.624$, is found from the simultaneous
	detection of emission features belonging to nebular lines, including \hi, \oii,
	\oiii, \neiii, \nii, \sii, \siii, and \hei~as well as absorption features due
	to the presence of \znii, \crii, \feii, \mnii, \mgii, \mgi, \tiii, and \caii,
	all at a consistent redshift. Temporal evolution of the fine-structure lines
	belonging to \feii$^*$ is found between the epochs.

	\subsection{GRB100424A (z=2.465)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	14291\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14291.gcn3}}. The spectrum
	has not otherwise been published previously. Observations carried out, long
	after the burst has faded.  Emission lines from the host are detected at
	$z=2.465$.

	\subsection{GRB100425A (z=1.1755)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	10684\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10684.gcn3}} and is used in
	\citet{Skuladottir2010}, but not published elsewhere. Observations started 4
	hours after the \textit{Swift} trigger, totaling 2.4 ks. Absorption features
	from \mgii~and \feii~in the afterglow continuum are detected at $z=1.1755$.

	\subsection{GRB100615A (z=1.398)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	14264\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14264.gcn3}}, but not

	\oii, \neiii, \oiii~and \ha~are detected at a common redshift of $z=1.398$.
	
	\subsection{GRB100621A (z=0.542)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	10876\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10876.gcn3}}, but not
	published elsewhere. Beginning 7.1 hours after the GRB, 2.4 ks observations
	reveal emission lines from \oii, \hb~and \oiii~at a common redshift of
	$z=0.542$ and a very weak afterglow continuum.

	\subsection{GRB100625A (z=0.452)}
	The data presented here is of the candidate host galaxy, taken long after the
	burst has faded and have not previously been published. 4.8 ks of exposure
	reveals a weak continuum present in all arms, but an absence of emission lines.
	This could indicate that the host primarily contains a older stellar
	population. The redshift, $z=0.452$, is taken from \citet{Fong2013}.

	
	\subsection{GRB100724A* (z = 1.288)}

	10971\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10971.gcn3}}. The spectrum
	has not otherwise been published previously. The observations were carried out
	in RRM starting 11 min after the GRB trigger. See section \ref{RRM}, for a
	description of the RRM scheme. Absorption lines from several ionic species are
	detected in the afterglow continuum at a common redshift of $z = 1.288$. This
	is not a part of the statistical sample.

	29.98 hrs after the burst, with an afteglow continuum visible in all arms for
	both visits. We detect absorption features from Ly-limit, \lya, \cii/\cii$^*$,
	\SIii/\SIii$^*$, \ali, \feii ~and \mgii ~are detected at a consistent redshift,

	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	14365\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14365.gcn3}}. The spectrum
	has not otherwise been published previously. The observations consists of two
	600sec spectra taken 1.9hr after the burst. We detect absorption features from
	a wide range of ions. We also detect intervening absorption at $z=1.255$ and
	$z=3.248$.
	
	\subsection{GRB130606A (z = 5.913)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#

	features from a wide range of ions at $z=5.913$ as well as intervening
	absorption at $z=2.313, 2.521, 3.415, 4.6448, 4.6468, 4 and 4.6495$.
	
	\subsection{GRB151021A (z = 2.330)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	18426\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/18982.gcn3}} and is not
	published elsewhere. The observation was carried out in RRM starting 44 min af
	the GRB trigger. We detect absorption features from a wide range of ions at
	$z=2.330$ as well as intervening absorption at $z=1.49$.

	\subsection{GRB160203A (z = 3.517)}
	The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
	18982\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/18982.gcn3}} and is not

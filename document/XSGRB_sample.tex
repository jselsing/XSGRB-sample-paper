\abstract{
The {\it Swift} satellite allows us to use gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to peer into 
the hearts of star forming galaxies through cosmic time. Our open
collaboration, representing most of the active ESO member researchers in this
field, seeks to build a public legacy sample of GRB X-shooter spectroscopy
while {\it Swift} continues to fly. We propose to continue our programme to target
all suitably observable GRB afterglows (up to 15 bursts per semester), with the
primary goal of producing a well-defined, homogeneous, statistically useful
sample. To date, our spectroscopy covers a redshift range from 0.059 to about
8, with more than 20 robust metallicity measurements from absorption lines (over 
the redshift range 1.7--5.9) and 4 secure detections of H$_2$ or CH molecular
absorption. Such information is extremely difficult to obtain by other means.
In terms of studying the spread and redshift evolution in gas-phase properties, the
sample is still limited by low-number statistics.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Only after observing more than 12000 damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs)
towards about 10$^5$ QSOs have 5 systems with 
$\log({N_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{cm^{-2}}}) > 22$
been identified (Noterdaeme et al.\ 2012, A\&A, 547, L1). Long GRB afterglow
spectra, by contrast, reveal such systems in the majority of cases (e.g., Jakobsson et
al.\ 2006, A\&A, 460, L13; Fynbo et al.\ 2009, ApJS, 185, 526).
Whereas DLAs towards QSOs are mostly limited to $1.8\lesssim z \lesssim 5$ due
to the atmospheric  UV-cutoff and increasing Lyman-blanketing at increasing
redshifts (e.g., Rafelski et al.\ 2014, ApJL, 782, L29), GRBs allow us to see 
into the hearts of star-forming galaxies over
the full history of cosmic star formation from $z \approx 0$ to $z > 8$ (e.g.,
Tanvir et al.\ 2009, Nature, 461, 1254; Salvaterra et al.\ 2009, Nature, 461,
1258; Jakobsson et al.\ 2012, ApJ, 752, 62). With afterglow spectroscopy
(throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to the sub-mm) we can hence
characterize the properties of star-forming galaxies over cosmic history in
terms of  redshifts, metallicities, molecular contents, ISM temperatures,
UV-flux densities, etc.. This is, however, only possible as long as there are
satellites in orbit that rapidly and accurately locate GRBs. The currently
operating \textit{Swift} satellite, launched in 2004 and still fully-functioning,
allows for very efficient follow-up observations of GRBs due to its
unprecedented rate, speed and precision of localisations.

%With GTO time on X-shooter we
%have started building a sample of afterglows with X-shooter spectroscopy.
%X-shooter is ideal for this with its high efficiency, wide wavelength coverage
%and spectral resolution sufficient for inferring the fundamental physical
%parameters just listed.

\smallskip
\smallskip

{\bf The case for a large sample of GRBs with X-shooter spectroscopy.}

There are
several unanswered but fundamental questions that must be addressed in order
to exploit the full potential of GRBs as cosmological probes.
%Among them: what is the true redshift distribution and corresponding luminosity
%function of long-duration GRBs?
More than 50\% of the \textit{Swift} bursts with measured redshift are at $z >
2$, and  5--10\% are expected to be above $z=5$ (Salvaterra et al. 2008, MNRAS, 380, L45; Salvaterra et al.\ 2012, ApJ, 749,
68; Jakobsson et al.\ 2012, ApJ, 752, 62; Perley et al.\ 2016, ApJ, 817, 7). 
A high redshift completeness is
crucial for our understanding of the link between the number density of GRBs
per unit redshift and the global star-formation history of the Universe, as
measured by other means (UV, FIR, sub-mm, see Robertson \& Ellis 2011, ApJ, 744,
95). The detection of GRBs at $z > 6$ shows that GRBs have become competitive as
a tool to identifying galaxies at the highest redshifts and unsurpassed in
providing detailed abundance information via absorption line spectroscopy
(Tanvir et al.\ 2012, ApJ, 754, 46, McGuire et al.\ 2016, ApJ submitted, 
arxiv:1512.07808).

\smallskip

%The sample of short GRBs with redshifts remains too small and too
%incomplete to really
%constrain their redshift distribution (Guetta \& Piran 2006, A\&A, 453, 823;
%Salvaterra et al.\ 2008, MNRAS, 388, 6) making it of extreme importance to
%enlarge as far as possible the number of known redshifts for this class of
%sources.

From March 2005 to March 2016 there have been about 350 {\it Swift} bursts 
complying with
our sample selection criteria (see ``Immediate objective''), and about half of them have
measured redshifts. Among the latter subset, the team proposing these observations has
measured about two thirds of the redshifts, mainly with FORS1/2 and X-shooter (see
Fynbo et al.\ 2009, ApJS, 185, 526;  Jakobsson et al.\ 2012, ApJ, 752, 62;
Kr\"uhler et al.\ 2012, ApJ, 758, 46). Our current aim is to build a sample superior to
our previous low-resolution survey (Fynbo et al.\ 2009, ApJS, 185, 526), both in
terms of quantity and  quality of the spectra. Our program started as 
guaranteed time observations during
periods 84-91, and we have continued in open time since then. 

%In P84 we started the X-shooter legacy survey in GTO time. Our aim is to  build
%a sample of GRBs superior to our previous  low-resolution  survey, Fynbo et al.\
%2009, ApJS, 185, 526) both in terms of quantity and  quality of the spectra. The
%last period of GTO time on the survey was P90 (plus 6 hr of leftover GTO time
%in  P91) and for P92 a proposal like this was  accepted for continuation of the
%program in open time (concerning P93 see box 8). 

\smallskip

X-shooter is in many ways
the ideal GRB follow-up instrument and indeed GRB follow-up was one of the
primary science cases behind the instrument design and implementation. Our
program secures general purpose GRB afterglow spectroscopic follow-up 
that adds strong legacy value to the \textit{Swift} GRB sample.
Due to the wide wavelength range of X-shooter  
with the same observation cover molecular H$_2$ absorption near the
atmospheric cut-off and all the strong emission lines from the host in the
NIR arm (e.g., Friis et al., 2015, MNRAS, 451, 167). In general, the wide wavelength coverage ensures that we always have
features on which to base a redshift measurement as long as the afterglow is
brighter than about 23 mag in either the $R$- or $z$-band. 
Frequently, emission lines are also detected from the underlying host, which
also provide further information such as SFR and metallicity (the top right 
panel in Fig.~1 shows an example). Only for 
7 out of more than 70 secured spectra could we not measure a redshift.   
With the X-shooter survey we
provide {\bf metallicity measurements} for about 30\% (Voigt-profile fits)
of the $z>1.7$ events.
So far we have
measured metallicities for more than 20 GRB afterglows with X-shooter.
With the wide wavelength coverage of X-shooter we can
study important chemical species as Zn\,\textsc{ii}, Cr\,\textsc{ii} and $\alpha$
elements over a much wider redshift range than what is possible with other
instruments.
As an example, we have measured a metallicity of $0.1 Z_\odot$ for GRB\,100219A
at $z=4.669$ (Th{\"o}ne et al.\ 2013, MNRAS, 428, 3590), $0.02Z_\odot$ for 
GRB\,111008A at $z=4.991$ (Sparre et al.\ 2014, ApJ, 785, 150) and $0.05Z_\odot$
for the $z=5.9125$ GRB\,130606A (Hartoog et al.\ 2015, A\&A, 580, 139).  
Reconciling the
abundance patterns of GRB absorbers, other types of absorbers, QSO DLAs
in particular, and old stars in the Local Group is an important long-term
goal (see also Sparre et al.\ 2014, ApJ, 785, 150).
Metallicities are also measured from host emission lines (Kr{\"u}hler et al.\ 2015,
A\&A, 581, A125).
GRB spectroscopy also allows us to determine the dust content of their environments,
both through analysis of the depletion pattern and through measurement of the
associated extinction (Japelj et al.\ 2015, A\&A, 451, 2050). 
This allows us to quantify the dust-to-metals ratio and its
evolution with redshift (e.g., De Cia et al.\ 2013, A\&A, 560, 88; Zafar \&
Watson 2013, A\&A, 560, 26).
%Moreover, GRB
%afterglows allow investigation of random foreground absorbers, complementing
%QSO sightline studies (e.g., Schulze et
%al.\ 2012, A\&A, 546, 20).

%In Fynbo et al. (2009, ApJS, 185,
%526), we compare the host-galaxy HI
%column density and metallicity (most of which has been measured by our group)
%with a sample of damped \lya\ systems (DLAs) along QSO sightlines. We show that
%most GRB-DLAs have a much larger column than QSO-DLAs.  The difference in
%column density and metallicity for GRB and QSO sightlines shows that the total
%cross-section for environments like those of GRBs must be less than a few
%percent of the total cross-section for QSO-DLAs, and suggests that GRB
%sightlines probe regions with high gas density.

%The issue of production and {\bf release of Lyman continuum radiation} is
%currently not fully understood, but the evidence suggests that star-forming
%galaxies are dominating, in particular at the highest redshifts (e.g., Bianchi
%et al.\ 2001, A\&A, 376, 1; Chen et al.\ 2007, ApJ, 667, L25). Also here
%X-shooter spectroscopy will allow major progress due to the excellent blue
%sensitivity.

%GRB afterglows can probe dust in high-redshift star-forming galaxies
%including exploring the {\bf 2175~\AA{} extinction bump}
%(El\'iasd\'ottir et al.\ 2009, ApJ, 697, 1725; Zafar et al.\ 2011, A\&A,
%732, 143).
%Due to the broad wavelength  coverage we can do
%this more accurately and over a broader range of redshifts with X-shooter.

\smallskip

We will also determine the frequency and properties of {\bf molecular
	absorption} towards GRB absorbers. Molecular gas is a key element to catalyze
the process of star formation, but prior to our program H$_2$ had been detected
just in two cases (tentatively in Fynbo et al.\ 2006, A\&A, 451, L47; securely
in Prochaska et al.\ 2009, ApJ, 691, L27). With our X-shooter program we have
found three more systems (Kr\"uhler et al.\ 2013, A\&A, 557, 18; D'Elia et al.\
2014, A\&A, 564, 38; Friis et al.\, 2015, MNRAS, 451, 167). 
We are currently analysing more of our spectra for less obvious molecular
absorption and we expect to find more (a dedicated sample paper is 
addressing this issue).

\vspace{0.2cm}
A natural question to ask is: {\bf how long should this work continue?} Our
view is that we need to keep observing the afterglows as long as we have
\textit{Swift} in operation. Also note that the program is still producing many 
papers and provides data for many theses (Box 9 and 10). \textit{Swift} is currently 
funded until 2018, but is likely to get more extensions given its overwhelming 
success. As
mentioned above GRBs allow us to probe star-forming galaxies that are almost
impossible to study in other ways both in terms of redshifts, galaxy luminosity
function, and regions within galaxies. After 7 periods we have 
secured seven spectra of $z>4$ GRBs, of which three were of sufficient quality to
allow abundance measurements (Th\"one et al.\ 2013, Sparre et al.\ 2014, 
Hartoog et al.\ 2015). GRBs offer the only way to derive chemical abundances 
for the gas phase of central, actively star-forming regions of high-$z$ galaxies. 
The program also maintains a very high discovery
potential where we occasionally find something completely unexpected that 
provides interesting clues to puzzles in other fields, e.g. extinction of 
type Ia supernovae (Fynbo et al.\ 2014, A\&A, 572, 12). Each of these spectra are like
precious jewels – it is a type of observation that can never be repeated and a
class of sightlines that can only be studied while we have operating GRB
satellites. 

It is also worth adding that we have build up a rather unique team spread over
Europe from Granada to Reykjavik, which by now has reached a point where the 
distribution of night shifts, the scientific exploitation of the data is 
efficient and where we are open to all new members who wish to participate.
As mentioned all data are public immediately.

{\bf For all of these reasons, we need to keep
	building up the sample of GRB afterglow spectra now as we may have to wait many
	years before a mission like \textit{Swift} becomes available again.}

A significant proportion of GRBs lack a bright optical afterglow (``{\bf dark bursts}'', e.g.,
Jakobsson et al.\ 2004, ApJ, 617, L21; Melandri et al.\ 2012, MNRAS, 421, 1265). 
Some of these are at the highest
redshifts ($z > 6$) and their observer-frame optical emission is absorbed by
the IGM. The majority, however, suffer from large dust obscuration (e.g., Perley
et al. 2009, AJ, 138, 1690; Greiner et al.\ 2011, A\&A, 526, 30).
Identifying such GRBs is important for
constraining the fraction of obscured star formation. In both cases,
NIR emission is
expected. X-shooter
can adequately study these objects, provided that a NIR counterpart is timely
identified, for which we have the dedicated HAWKI run D. 

The detection of {\bf absorption line variability} can reveal the burst
influence on the surrounding medium and in turn the absorber distance from the
burst and its metallicity (Vreeswijk et al.\ 2007, A\&A 468, 83; D'Elia et al.\
2009, ApJ, 694, 332; Th\"one et al.\ 2011, MNRAS, 414, 479; De Cia et al.\
2012, A\&A, 545, 64; Hartoog et al.\ 2013).
{\bf Short GRBs} originate in a substantially different
environment compared to long GRBs. Short GRBs may be related to the merging of
compact binaries and the coalescence time can be long enough to allow the
progenitor system to move far away from the star formation site (Belczynski et
al.\ 2002, ApJ, 571, 147). Up to now, however, no spectrum with a sufficient 
signal-to-noise ratio
of a short GRB afterglow has been secured.
A knowledge of the redshift distribution
of short bursts is of key importance for the next generation of gravitational
wave experiments, as they are the likely EM counterparts to their
primary targets.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sample selection criteria} \label{samplecrit}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Being of transient nature, it is difficult to impose strong sample selection
criteria on GRBs, without hampering the follow-up effort. Many natural follow-up
restrictions exists from already, being it weather conditions, pointing
restrictions of the telescope or poorly localized bursts as reported by the
\textit{Swift}-telescope. To maximize the return of the follow-up campaign
we have chosen a few selection criteria that attempts to provide an unbiased
selection of bursts, while allowing for a high success-rate 



\footnote{Note that in the P84 proposal the criteria have
been stated a bit differently, the visibility constraint being replaced by a
declination + Sun angle constraint. The above criteria are however those
defining the sample.}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item GRB triggered onboard by Swift.
	\item Galactic $A_V \lesssim 0.5$ mag.
	\item XRT started observing within 10 minutes since the GRB; an XRT position must be distributed within 12 hr.
	\item The target must be visible for at least 60 minutes at least 30 degrees above the horizon, with the Sun below -12.
	\item No bright closeby stars.
	
\end{enumerate}


A significant fraction of the bursts presented here \todo{Insert exact
number} have already had their hosts investigated in \citet{Kruhler2015}, for
which extractions of the hosts exist. The focus of the data presented here are
on the afterglows themselves and in the absence of a clear afterglow, the host.
We will not, however, investigate the hosts.

We simultaneously want to minimize any biases against astrophysical conditions
while at the same time maximizing likelihood of observations. By restricting
the selection criteria to conditions local to Galaxy.

during the duration of this follow-up campaign, which covers the entire lifetime
of X-shooter. Observations have been carried out from the ESO period P84

The first GRB followed up is GRB090313, observed 15th of March 2009, which was
while X-shooter was mounted on UT3 during the commissioning of the instrument.
The bursts observed during the commisioning period is not a part of our
statistical sample, but are nonetheless published as part of the bursts observed
by the X-shooter GRB team. The first burst observed after science verification
was completed when X-shooter was moved to UT2 is GRB091018 which thereby
constitute the first burst entering our statistical sample. For all bursts that
fulfill our sample selection criteria, described in Sect. \ref{samplecrit},
spectroscopic follow-up has been attempted with X-shooter. Various conditions
can affect our ability to follow up a given burst, and a discussion of this
effect is included in Sect. \ref{badbursts}.

X-shooter can cover the spectral wavelength region from 3000 \AA~to 24800 \AA~in
a single exposure, by splitting the light in three separate spectroscopic arms
using dichroics.
This way each arm work as a separate instrument, each functioning as its own
echelle spectrograph.
The ultraviolet blue(UVB) arm covering 3000 - 5500 \AA, the visual(VIS) arm
covering 5500 - 10200 \AA, and the near-infrared()NIR) arm covering 10200 -
24800 \AA~ with the possibility of applying a k-band
blocking filter cutting the coverage of the NIR arm at 10200 - 21000 \AA.


\todo{ABBA}


For the large majority of the bursts we have observed with a slit width of
1\farc0, 0\farc9, and 0\farc9 for the UVB, VIS, and NIR-arm respectively, which
puts a lower limit on the delivered resolution of the spectra based on the
tabulated values of the delivered resolutions, which is 4350, 7450, and 5300 for
the UVB, VIS and NIR-arm respectively\footnote{\url{https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/xshooter/inst.html}}.
The slit width also sets the width of the atmospheric sky lines and determines
the amount of light lost due to the wavelength-dependent seeing PSF extending
outside the coverage of the slit, where the width of sky-lines is always set by
the slit width whereas both the delivered resolution and the slitloss changes
for the better as the seeing PSF drops below the slit width.
For atmospheric conditions delivering a seeing PSF with a FWHM of 0\farc9
observed with a 0\farc9 slit only 76.1 percent of the light will enter the slit,
meaning that for almost all observations a slitloss correction is required. We
describe how slitlosses were corrected for in Sect. \ref{postproc}.
For accurate measurements of velocity widths, a precise instrumental resolution
is required and this becomes better when the delivered seeing is better than the
slit width. We discuss this in Sect. \ref{resolution}.

\section{Data processing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we describe how the final data products are produced and
subsequently post-processed. All post-processing scripts developed for this
dataset are made publicly available at
\url{https://github.com/jselsing/XSGRB_reduction_scripts}, along with
instructions of use.

Before any reductions are done, the raw object images are run through the
cosmic-ray removal algorithm \citep{VanDokkum2001} implementation,
\textit{Astro-SCRAPPY} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/astropy/astroscrappy}},
where a wide clipping radius have been used around detected cosmics to ensure that edge residuals are
robustly rejected. 

The basis for the reductions is the VLT/X-shooter pipeline, version
\texttt{2.7.1} or newer \citep{Goldoni2006, Modigliani2010}. The pipeline is
managed with the Reflex interface \citep{Freudling2013} and is used for
subtraction of bias level, flat-fielding, tracing of the echelle orders,
wavelength calibrations with the use of arc-line lamps, flux calibration using
spectrophotometric standards \citep{Vernet2010, Hamuy1994}, mirror flexure
compensation, initial sky-subtraction and lastly the rectification and merging
of the orders. For the initial sky-subtraction, the background has been
estimated in regions adjacent to the object trace clear of contaminating
sources. Because of the broken ADC, for some objects there is a lot of curvature
in the object trace. This means that for some bursts, the initial sky-estimate
has been made from a limited number of pixels in the spatial direction. By doing
an initial subtracting the sky on the un-rectified image we ensure that bulk of
the sky background is not redistributed by the rectification process.

The image is rectified onto an equidistant grid with a dispersion sampling of
0.2 \AA/pixel and a 0.16 "/pixel spatial sampling for the UVB and VIS arm and
0.6 \AA/pixel with a 0.21 "/pixel in the NIR arm.  Because the tabulated
resolution is a lower limit, by choosing a sampling of 0.2 \AA/pixel, we ensure
that the bluest part of neither of the arms have a sampling lower than the
Nyquist sampling rate of 2 pixels per resolution FWHM.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Post-processing} \label{postproc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For a typical observation, each of the exposures in the nodding sequence has
been reduced as single observation and then subsequently combined to form a
single image. Because this strategy is employed, we can reject outliers in the
stack and weight by the average inverse variance of the background. When
weighting images where the noise in each pixel is dominated by Poisson noise it
important to estimate the background variance in a large enough region, so that
to remove the correlation between the signal and the weights. To this end, the
weight map is generated by a running median window over the variance map, where
the trace as been masked and width of the window is chosen to be wide enough for
median variance to be generated on the basis of several hundred pixels. This
weighting scheme automatically also optimally combines images of different
exposure times or images where the background is varying, which is often the
case when a burst has been observed close to twilight

Because the background is very bright and there is a high abundance of broad
sky-lines in the NIR arm, when there are no contaminating sources in the slit,
the sky has been put back on the images and they have been reduced in pairs of
two, subtracting the two from each other, keeping the WCS static. This amounts
to the regular nodding reduction, only we can reject outliers and weight by the
averaged inverse variance map.

By STARE reducing all observations we additionally get a spectrum of the sky,
which we can use to calibrate the wavelength solution in Sect. \ref{wavecal}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Correction for offsets in the wavelength calibration}    \label{wavecal}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

X-shooter, being installed at the VLT Cassegrain focus is  prone to flexures
during operations. The flexures modify the projection of the slit on the
detector with respect to the one obtained in daytime calibration. This requires a
modification of the wavelength solution in order to process correctly the
night-time data. Part of this correction is performed by the pipeline using the
frames taken during X-shooter Active Flexure Compensation procedure
\footnote{X-shooter User Manual available at
	https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/xshooter/doc.html}.

The remaining offset is corrected by cross-correlation with a synthetic sky
spectrum \citep{Noll2012, Jones2013} after the continuum, estimated as the mode
of all flux values, has been subtrated. To get the correct seeing PSF with which
to convolve the synthetic sky an initial refinement of the wavelength solution
have been obtained by cross-correlating the observed sky with an unconvolved
synthetic sky. This preliminary wavelength calibration is applied to the
observed sky. The synthetic spectrum is then convolved with an increasing seeing
PSF and the width that minimizes $\chi^2$ with the updated observed sky is
chosen to be the effective sky-PSF. Using the synthetic sky with the matched
resolution, a final wavelength calibration can then be calculated by
cross-correlating the observed sky with the correctly broadened sky spectrum, as
a function of a velocity offset. Both a multiplicative and an additive offset to
the wavelength calibration has been tested, but in terms of $\chi^2$, the model
with only a multiplicative offset is preferred.

The resulting offsets, which were smaller than 0.1 \AA~in the UVB and VIS data
and smaller than 0.5 \AA~in the NIR spectra, but changing over short period of
time were applied to the corresponding spectra.

Using the convolved synthetic sky, the $\gtrsim 3 \sigma$ sky brightness pixels
have been added to the bad pixel map to avoid the cores of the brightest
sky-lines.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Spectral extraction}    \label{extract}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To extract the afterglow spectrum from the rectified 2D-image, several
techniques have been employed based on the brightness of the afterglow and the
complexity of the objects entering the slit. Due to the malfunctioning ADC, see
Sect. \ref{obs}, the spectral trace moves across the slit as a function of
wavelength for a large fraction of the bursts observed meaning that using a
single aperture for the spectral extraction is inadequate due to the large
amount of background that would then enter the slit. To optimally select the
extraction regions we therefore need to model the trace position.

To get the shape and the position of the spectral PSF as a function of location
on the image, we need to chose a model which can represent how the light falls
on the slit. We know from \citet{Trujillo2001} that the Moffat function
\citep{Moffat1969} adequately describes an imaging PSF due to atmospheric
turbulence, but due to the aberrations in the dispersion elements and the
rectification process, the PSF we are trying to model different from this
profile. To allow for flexibility in the model, we have chosen the Voigt
function as a model for the spectral PSF and we describe how this is evaluated
in App. \ref{voigt}. Since additionally, the host galaxy could also have a
contribution the image profile, this choice allows for the required freedom if
additional flux is in the wings of the profile.

To guide the guess position of the trace on the slit as a function of
wavelength, we have used the analytic prescription for the trace position
described in \citet{Filippenko1982}, where the header keywords of the
observations have been queried for the ambient conditions which controls the
degree to which the trace moves.

Based on the signal-to-noise of the afterglow continuum, the 2D-image has been
binned down in the spectral direction to a number of elements that allows for an
accurate tracing of the PSF, typically 200 bins for moderate signal-to-noise.
For each of the bins and using the guess position, the spectral PSF has been fit
using the unweighted chi-squared minimization algorithm implemented in
\texttt{scipy.optimize.curve\_fit} \citep{scipy}. Since we know that the trace
varies slowly as a function of wavelength, we have then fitted a low-order
polynomial to the fit parameters as a function of wavelength, which allows us to
evaluate the spectral PSF at all wavelengths and this way accurately model the
entire spectral PSF.

Equipped with a model for how the light falls on the entire image, we can then
employ the optimal extraction algorithm \cite{Horne1986}, which weights the
extraction aperture by the spectral profile, or alternatively sum all pixels
within 1 FWHM of the modeled profile. Where possible, we have used the optimal
extraction. In cases where the trace is very weak, even in the binned images, an
aperture has been selected manually which covers emission lines, if present, and
when nothing is immediately visible, the entire nodding window. The error- and
bad pixel maps are in all cases propagated throughout the extraction.

In cases where multiple traces are visible in the slit, additional components
for the profile are used in the optimal extraction. The additional components
do not share the PSF parameters and in cases where the additional component is an
extended object, the fits have been inspected to ensure that the additional
component does now skew the fit towards a different PSF. The additional
components are not used for the weights.

The spectra are corrected for galactic extinction using the E(B-V) value from
the dust maps of \citet{Schlegel1998} with the update in
\citet{Schlafly2011}\footnote{Queried from
	http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/index.html using
	\citet{astroquery}}, and the extinction curve by \cite{Cardelli1989} with a
total to selective extinction $R_V = 3.1$. The wavelengths of the extracted
1D-spectra are moved to vacuum, moved to the barycentric frame, and the
wavelength recalibration described in Sect. \ref{wavecal} is applied. Pixels
with pixel-to-pixel variation large than $50 \sigma$ are added to the bad pixel
map.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Telluric correction} \label{tell_corr}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For all earth-based telescopes the light of interest has to pass through Earths
atmosphere, where the atmospheric content and conditions make an imprint on the
received spectrum. These telluric features can be calculated in a multitude of
ways and we employ a prioritized list of methods here, depending on the
availability of the different method. Since the observation are often taken at
odd times under varying conditions, this prioritized list ensures that we are
always doing the optimal correction.

The highest priority method is using the GRB afterglow continuum itself, where
the atmospheric conditions have directly been imprinted on the spectrum. The
telluric features can directly be fit with an atmospheric model
\citep{Smette2015, Kausch2015}, which can then be to correct for the absorption.
The requirement here is that the afterglow continuum spectrum has a
signal-to-noise higher than a value of 10.

If the afterglow is not sufficiently bright, telluric standard stars observed
close in the time to the GRB can be used as a proxy for the atmospheric
condition during the GRB observation. Here we employ the telluric correction
method that has been developed in \citet{Selsing2015}, where a library of
synthetic templates is fit to the observed telluric standard.

In the last case, where the object is neither bright enough, or there for some
reason have not been observed a telluric standard, we rely on the synthetic sky
model by \citep{Noll2012, Jones2013} for which we generate a synthetic
transmission spectrum, which we then use, where the ambient parameters for the
observations have been used.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Spectral resolution} \label{resolution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The afterglow spectra described in this paper are obtained in
Target-of-Opportunity (override) mode.
In most cases there is therefore little possibility to tweak slit widths to the
seeing at the time of observations (i.e. to optimise spectral resolution and
signal to noise), and almost all our data is therefore taken with a fixed set
of slit widths and binning, described above.
In a fair number of cases, the seeing full width at half maximum (FWHM) is
considerably smaller than the silt width, and the delivered spectral resolution
will then be determined by the seeing rather than slit width, as afterglows are
point sources (this is evidently not the case for extended sources, e.g for
host galaxies).
The delivered resolution for slit width dominated spectra post-reduction and
extraction can easily be determined from the bright sky emission lines.
For afterglow spectra with very high signal to noise, the delivered spectral
resolution can at times be determined from the science data themselves.
However, in the presence of multiple velocity components in absorption, other
forms of line broadening, and a lack of lines at some redshifts, this is
difficult to do at poorer signal to noise ratios (the majority of spectra in
our sample).
A broad starting value for the expect resolution will help fitting of these
spectra, and can be important in upper limit determination, and for this reason
we construct a aim to construct a crude relation between the seeing and the
delivered resolution at our slit width, binning, and reduction pipeline
settings.
To this end we use observations of telluric standard stars that are taken with
identical instrument settings as our afterglow spectra, usually just after the
science data, as part of the ESO X-shooter calibration plan.
These spectra have been reduced together with the afterglow spectra, using
identical pipeline settings with the same version of the pipeline.
First we fit a Gaussian function in the spatial direction of the trace of the
standard star at 792 nm (i.e. in the VIS arm).
After this, we fit a series of  20 telluric absorption lines in the telluric
standard star spectra with Gaussians, taking care to select transitions that
are not almost-resolved multiples, should be intrinsically unresolved, and are
in areas with well defined continuum flux.
We pick 34 telluric standard stars spanning a range of DIMM seeing values, with
the majority between $0.5-1.5 arcsec$.
The resulting distribution of spectral FWHM (km/s) as a function of spatial
FWHM at 792 nm is fairly well described by a linear relation $a + b*x$, with
$x$ the spatial FWHM in pixels (with 0.15 arc sec per pixel),  $a= 21.4 \pm
1.3$ km/s, $b=1.4 \pm 0.2$.
We use this linear relation as a way to estimate the spectral resolution for
medium to poor signal to noise afterglow spectra in the VIS arm.
To extend this to the UVB and NIR arm, we measured a series of lines in NIR arm
spectra of a subset of 19 sources used for the VIS arm above, and find that the
resulting distribution is consistent with a simple scaling of the VIS arm
relation by the ratio of resolutions of the NIR and VIS arm for unresolved,
slit filling, sources as given on the ESO instrument website.
The UVB arm contains no suitable absorption lines to use, and we therefore use
a scaled value as in the NIR arm.
While this simple method is not terribly accurate (for one, the spatial profile
of the trace is not a perfect Gaussian), but it gives a sufficiently accurate
estimate for the analysis of these poor signal to noise science spectra.

\section{The complex error function and the Voigt profile} \label{voigt}
When modeling the spectral PSF, we need to evaluate the Voigt-profile. The Voigt profile, which is the convolution of the Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles, can, centered at zero, be written as \citep{pagnini2010} 
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
V(\lambda,\sigma, \gamma)  
& = G(\lambda, \sigma)  \otimes L(\lambda, \gamma) \\
& = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} G(\xi, \sigma) L(\lambda - \xi, \gamma) d\xi \\
& = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} e^{- \left( \frac{\xi}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}  \right)^2 } \frac{1}{\gamma \pi} \frac{\gamma^2}{(\lambda - \xi)^2 + \gamma^2} d\xi \\
& = \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{2} \sigma} \frac{1}{ \pi^{3/2}}   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{- \left( \frac{\xi}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}  \right)^2 }}{(\lambda - \xi)^2 + \gamma^2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We can by making the following substitution, $\xi = \sqrt{2} \sigma$ and $d\xi = \sqrt{2} \sigma dt$, write it as
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
V(\lambda,\sigma, \gamma)  
& =  \frac{\sqrt{2} \sigma}{ \sqrt{{\pi}}} \frac{\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}}{\pi}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{- t^2 }}{(\lambda - \sqrt{2} \sigma t)^2 + \gamma^2} dt \\
& = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma}  \frac{\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}}{\pi}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{- t^2 }}{\left(\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2} \sigma} -  t\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}\right)^2} dt.	
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This form of the convolution is closely related to the complex probability function \citep{letchworth2007, abrarov2015a},
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
W(z)  
& = \frac{i}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{z - t}  
\end{split}
\end{equation}
for any complex argument, $z = x + iy$. The complex probability function can be expressed as a sum of a real an imaginary part \citep{benner1995, abrarov2015b},
\begin{equation} 
\begin{split}
W(x, y)  
& = K(x, y) + i L(x, y) \\
& = \frac{y}{\pi}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{- t^2 }}{(x -  t)^2 +y^2} dt  + \frac{i}{\pi}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{(x - t)e^{- t^2 }}{(x -  t)^2 +y^2} dt,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where is the real part, $\mathtt{Re}[W(x, y)] =  \sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma V(\lambda,\sigma, \gamma)$ if $x = \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}$ and $y = \frac{\gamma}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}$, which can be obtained by using the complex argument, $z = \frac{\lambda + i\gamma}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}$, in the complex probability function. If $\mathtt{Im}[z] \geq 0$, which is always guaranteed for the width of a spectral profile, the complex probability function equals the complex error function. The complex error function has numerous, fast, numerical approximations where in this work we use the \texttt{scipy.special.wofz} \citep{scipy} implementation.

\section{Notes on Individual objects}

\subsection{GRB090313}

\subsection{GRB100205A}
Observed 3 days after the \textit{Swift} trigger. No afterglow or host detected
in 10.8 ks. GRB likely located at high
redshift\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10399.gcn3}}. The spectrum
has not otherwise been published previously.

\subsection{GRB100219A (z = 4.667)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
10441\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10441.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{Thone2013}. Observations started 12.5 hours after the \textit{Swift}
trigger and has a total exposure time of 4.8 ks. Absorption features, including
those of \lya, from a multitude of ions are detected against the afterglow
continuum at $z = 4.667$. Additionally, absorption from an intervening system
is found at $z = 2.181$.

\subsection{GRB100316B (z = 1.180)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
10495\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10495.gcn3}}. The spectrum
has not otherwise been published previously. Observations started 44 minutes
after the \textit{Swift} trigger and has a total exposure time of 2.4 ks.
Absorption features from \feii, \alii, \aliii,	\mgii~and \mgi~are well detected
against the afterglow continuum at $z = 1.180$. Additionally, strong absorption
lines from \feii~and \mgii~from an intervening system are found at $z = 1.063$.

\subsection{GRB100316D (z = 0.059)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
10512\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10512.gcn3}}, GCN \#
10513\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10513.gcn3}}, GCN \#
10543\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10543.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{Bufano2012} and \citet{Starling2011}. This GRB is very close by and
has an associated SN, SN2010bh, and has therefore undergone intense follow-up. The data
presented here consists of a subset of the entire VLT/X-shooter campaign,
covering the four first observing days while the afterglow still contributes
significantly to the total emission. The first observations started 10 hours
after the burst, before the SN was discovered, and targeted the star-forming
'A'-region\citep{Starling2011}, not the GRB. A very rich spectrum containing a
multitude of emission lines puts the host at $z = 0.059$. For three consequtive
nights, 58, 79 and 101 hours after the \textit{Swift} trigger, the afterglow
was observed as it transitioned into the spectrum of a high-velocity Ic-BL SN.
The observations taken 79 and 101 hours after the burst are taken under
programme 084.D-0265(A) (PI: Benetti), but with an identical setup to the first
two observations.

\subsection{GRB100418A (z=0.624)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
10620\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10620.gcn3}} and GCN \#
10631\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10631.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{DeUgartePostigo2011}. The burst have been followed up in three epochs
of observations, 0.4, 1.4, and 2.4 days after the burst, each lasting 4.8 ks.
The unambiguous redshift of the host, $z=0.624$, is found from the simultaneous
detection of emission features belonging to nebular lines, including \hi, \oii,
\oiii, \neiii, \nii, \sii, \siii, and \hei~as well as absorption features due
to the presence of \znii, \crii, \feii, \mnii, \mgii, \mgi, \tiii, and \caii,
all at a consistent redshift. Temporal evolution of the fine-structure lines
belonging to \feii$^*$ is found between the epochs.

\subsection{GRB100424A (z=2.465)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
14291\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14291.gcn3}}. The spectrum
has not otherwise been published previously. Observations carried out, long
after the burst has faded.  Emission lines from the host are detected at
$z=2.465$.

\subsection{GRB100425A (z=1.1755)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
10684\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10684.gcn3}} and is used in
\citet{Skuladottir2010}, but not published elsewhere. Observations started 4
hours after the \textit{Swift} trigger, totaling 2.4 ks. Absorption features
from \mgii~and \feii~in the afterglow continuum are detected at $z=1.1755$.

\subsection{GRB100615A (z=1.398)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
14264\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14264.gcn3}}, but not
published elsewhere. Host observation of a dark burst\citep{DElia2011} taken
long after the afterglow has faded. Emission lines from the host belonging to
\oii, \neiii, \oiii~and \ha~are detected at a common redshift of $z=1.398$.

\subsection{GRB100621A (z=0.542)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
10876\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10876.gcn3}}, but not
published elsewhere. Beginning 7.1 hours after the GRB, 2.4 ks observations
reveal emission lines from \oii, \hb~and \oiii~at a common redshift of
$z=0.542$ and a very weak afterglow continuum.

\subsection{GRB100625A (z=0.452)}
The data presented here is of the candidate host galaxy, taken long after the
burst has faded and have not previously been published. 4.8 ks of exposure
reveals a weak continuum present in all arms, but an absence of emission lines.
This could indicate that the host primarily contains a older stellar
population. The redshift, $z=0.452$, is taken from \citet{Fong2013}.


\subsection{GRB100724A* (z = 1.288)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
10971\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/10971.gcn3}}. The spectrum
has not otherwise been published previously. The observations were carried out
in RRM starting 11 min after the GRB trigger. See section \ref{RRM}, for a
description of the RRM scheme. Absorption lines from several ionic species are
detected in the afterglow continuum at a common redshift of $z = 1.288$. This
is not a part of the statistical sample.

\subsection{GRB100728B (z=2.106)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
11317\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/11317.gcn3}}. The spectrum
has not otherwise been published previously. Starting 22 hours after the burst
trigger, 7.2 ks of observations reveals a faint afterglow continuum with \lya-
and \mgii-absorption at $z=2.106$. Due to a malfunctioning ADC, the sensitivity
of X-shooter is depressed with respect to normal operations, resulting in a
poorer throughout. Additionally, the position of the trace on the slit moves
due to atmospheric differential refraction.

\subsection{GRB100814A (z=1.439)}
The spectra presented here has not been published previously. The
observations consists of three visits, the first beginning only 0.9 hours
after the \textit{Swift} trigger, the other two visits were 2.13 and 98.40
hours after the trigger, respectively. A bright afterglow continuum is
present in all visits, allowing identification of absorption features
belonging to a wide range of ions at $z=1.439$. A complex velocity structure
in the absorption features belonging to \mgii, shows several components,
separated by as much as 500km/s, pointing to a likely merger scenario in
the host.

\subsection{GRB100816A (z=0.805)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
11123\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/11123.gcn3}}. The spectrum
has not otherwise been published previously. This short GRB was observed 28.4
hours after the GRB trigger. 4 x 1200 s of exposure reveals two distinct sets
of emission lines, spatially offset $\lesssim 1 \arcsec $, very close in
redshift space, $z=0.8034$ and $z=0.8049$, indicating either an interacting
host or some complex velocity structure of the host. Faint underlying continua
are present under both sets of lines.

\subsection{GRB100901A (z=1.408)}
The data presented here has been published in \citet{Hartoog2013}. Because of
the unusual lingering brightness of this GRB, 2.4s of observations taken 65.98
hours after the GRB trigger still reveals an afterglow continuum visible across
the entire spectral coverage of X-shooter. Absorption lines from a wide range
ion put the redshift at $z=1.408$, with intervening absorption systems at $z =
1.3147$ and $z = 1.3179$.

\subsection{GRB101219A (z=0.718)}
This data has not been published before. Starting 3.7 hours after the GRB
trigger, 7.2 ks of exposure time reveals a very faint continuum in the visual
and near-infrared, only visible when heavily binning the images. No redshift
estimate is available from these observations.  Late-time Gemini-North
observations reveal emission lines from the host at
$z=0.718$\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/11518.gcn3}}.

\subsection{GRB101219B (z=0.552)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
11579\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/11579.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{Sparre2011}.	The first observation, taken 11.6 hours after the burst
trigger and lasting 4.8ks, reveals absorption from \mgii~and \mgi~in the host
located at $z = 0.552$ on a featureless continuum visible across the entire
coverage of X-shooter.  Subsequent observations taken 16 and 37 days after the
trigger shows the fading spectral signature of a SN, SN2010ma.

\subsection{GRB120118B (z = 2.943)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
14225\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14225.gcn3}}, but is not
published otherwise. This late-time observation of the host of GRB120118B
consists of 3.6 ks exposures and contains emission lines belonging to \oii and
\oiii at $z =	2.943$, suggested to be redshift of the host.

\subsection{GRB120119A (z = 1.728)}
The data presented here has not been published before. Three epochs of
observations have been obtained, the first two immediately after the burst, and
the last one long after the afterglow had faded. Starting 1.4 hours after the
\textit{Swift} trigger, the first epoch contains bright afterglow continuum.
Rich in absorption features belonging to a multitude of ions, $z =	1.728$ is
estimated for the host with intervening systems at $z =	1.476$, $z = 1.214$, $z
= 0.662$ and $z = 0.632$. The second epoch, obtained 4.5 hours after the burst
contains the fading afterglow. A third epoch is obtained $>1$ year after the
GRB in which emission lines from \hb~and \ha~are found at the redshift of the
host, confirming the association of the absorption line system and the host.

\subsection{GRB120211A (z = 2.346)}
The data presented here has been published in \citet{Kruhler2015}. Two
observations of the host of GRB120211A has been obtained, starting 2013.02.17,
$> 1 year$ after the burst has faded. A redshift for this object has been
reported by \citet{Kruhler2015} and the features seen by those authors are
reproduced in these reductions, confirming $z =	2.346$.

\subsection{GRB120224A (z = 1.10 NEW!!!)}
The data presented here has formed the basis of GCN \#
12991\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/12991.gcn3}}, and has also
been published in \citet{Kruhler2015}. Starting 19.8 hours after the GRB
trigger, a total exposure time of 2.4 ks reveals a faint continuum, starting at
$\sim$ 7000 \AA~and extending all the way through 25000 \AA. We detect a $\sim
2 \sigma$ emission line which, if interpreted as \ha, gives $z = 1.10$,
supporting the redshift reported by \citet{Kruhler2015}.

\subsection{GRB120311 (z = 0.350 NEW!!!)}
The data presented here has formed the basis of GCN \#
12991\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/12991.gcn3}}, but is not
published otherwise. Starting just before twilight, 3.65 hours after the burst,
a faint afterglow continuum is detected at all wavelengths. Due to the
faintness of the afterglow, no absorption features are discernible superposed
on the continuum. Displaced from the afterglow continuum by 1\farc4, emission
lines belonging to \hb, \oiii~and \ha~are detected at $z = 0.350$. The line
belonging to \ha~shows some extended emission toward the afterglow continuum.
The angular distance between the two sources correspond to a projected distance
in the host plane of 6 kpc, posing a potential problem for the host redshift,
unless the GRB ocurred in a merging system. The extended emission in \ha,
supports this interpretation. This burst is not apart of the statistical sample.

\subsection{GRB120327A (z = 2.813)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
13134\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13134.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{DElia2014}. The observation consists of two visits, 2.13 hrs and
29.98 hrs after the burst, with an afteglow continuum visible in all arms for
both visits. We detect absorption features from Ly-limit, \lya, \cii/\cii$^*$,
\SIii/\SIii$^*$, \ali, \feii ~and \mgii ~are detected at a consistent redshift,
$z = 2.813$.

\subsection{GRB120404A (z = 2.876)}
The data presented here has formed the basis of GCN \#
13227\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13227.gcn3}}, but is not
published otherwise. 9.6 ks integration, starting 15.7 hours after the
\textit{Swift}-trigger reveals a low-intensity afterglow continuum on which
absorption from \lya is detected in two distinct regions at redshifts $z=2.876$
and $z=.255$. These absorption systems are confirmed by ionic absorption
features at both of these redshifts.


\subsection{GRB120422A (z = 0.283)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
13257\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13257.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{Schulze2014}. A GRB-SN, this burst has been followed up multiple
times. The data presented here only contain the first epoch in which the
afterglow is still visible and before the rise of SN2012bz. Starting 16.5 hours
after the burst, 4.8 ks integration time captures both the host and the burst
in emission. A blue afterglow continuum is detected at all wavelengths covered
by X-shooter, on which \mgii absorption at $z = 0.283$ is found. Offset by
1\farc75, the host is clearly detected at a consistent redshift with a rich
emission line spectrum, the lines extending towards to burst.

\subsection{GRB120712A (z = 4.175)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
13460\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13460.gcn3}} and is not
published elsewhere. 4.8 ks integration time, starting 10.5 hours after the BAT
trigger, shows a bright afterglow continuum starting at $\sim$ 4720 \AA,
signifying the onset of the Lyman alpha forest, for a GRB located at $z =
4.175$. Absorption features from \lya, \feii, \mgii~and \SIii~are readily
detected at a consistent redshift.

\subsection{GRB120714B (z = 0.398)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
13477\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13477.gcn3}}, but is not
published elsewhere. Observations of this burst started 7.8 hours after the GRB
trigger, lasting 4.8 ks. A continuum is visible across the entire spectral
coverage of X-shooter, with both emission lines from  \oii, \hb, \oiii~and \ha,
as well as absorption from \mgii~detected at $z = 0.398$, securely setting it
as the redshift of the GRB.


\subsection{GRB120716A (z = 2.486)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
13494\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13494.gcn3}}, but is not
published elsewhere. Despite observations starting 62 hours after the
\textit{Swift} trigger and lasting 3.6 ks, a bright afterglow is clearly seen,
along with a plethora of absorption features. Absorption of \lya-photons in the
host leaves a broad trough, from which the Lyman alpha forest is visible
bluewards, all the way down to the Lyman limit. Metal absorption lines from
\cii, \SIii, \oi, \feii, \civ, \SIiv, including fine structure transitions
identified as \cii$^*$, \SIii$^*$, \feii$^*$ and metastable \NIii~lines are all
detected at $z = 2.486$

\subsection{GRB120805A (z $\sim$ 3.9 NEW!!!)}
A separate reduction of this burst has been published in \citet{Kruhler2015},
but not otherwise. Starting 9 days after the burst trigger, this is host
observation and does not contain any afterglow continuum. In 3.6 ks integration
time, we detect a faint continuum visible from 4500 \AA~and all the way through
21000 \AA, in contrast to what is found previously. The continuum from 4500 -
6000 \AA is detected at very low significance. If the drop at 4500 \AA~is the
Lyman limit, this fits with Lyman alpha at $\sim$ 6000 \AA, giving $z \sim
3.9$. The absence of nebular lines if due to \oii~falling in a telluric
absorption band and the rest being shifted out of the wavelength coverage.

\subsection{GRB120815A* (z = 2.358)} 
Not a part of the statistical sample, thisburst also formed the basis of  GCN
\# 13649\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13649.gcn3}} and is
published in \citet{Kruhler2013}. Observations started 1.69 hours after the BAT
trigger and consist of 2.4 ks integration. A bright afterglow continuum is
detected across the entire spectral coverage of X-shooter, with a multitude of
absorption lines superposed. Absorption features from the host at $z = 2.358$
include a DLA as well as metal absorption lines from \nv, \sii, \SIii, \oi,
\civ, \SIiv, \feii, \alii, \aliii, \mnii, \mgii, and \mgi. Additionally
fine-structure lines from \NIii and \feii are exited local to the GRB.
Intervening systems are found at $z = 1.539$, $z = 1.693$, and $z = 2.00$.

\subsection{GRB120722A (z = 0.959)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
13507\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13507.gcn3}}, but is not
published elsewhere. On 4.8 ks integration time, starting 10 hours after the
burst trigger, the simultaneous detection of absorption features belonging to
\mgii~and \feii~superposed on a blue continuum, and emission lines from \oii,
\hg, \hb, \oiii~and \ha, all at $z = 0.959$, confidently sets it as the
redshift of the GRB.

\subsection{GRB120909A (z = 3.929)}
The data presented here has formed the basis of GCN \#
13730\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13730.gcn3}}, but is not
published otherwise. A very rapid follow-up, starting only 1.7 hours after the
BAT trigger, this 1.2 ks observation captures a very bright afterglow
continuum, starting at 4500 \AA, signifying the onset of the Lyman limit for a 
system at $z = 3.929$. Absorption from high-column density hydrogen leaves very
prominent absorption features in the form of \lya, \lyb, and \lyg, visible in
the Lyman alpha forest. Metal absorption lines arising from \feii, \NIii,
\SIii, \sii, \alii, \aliii, \cii, \oi, \civ, and \znii~are all detected along
with the corresponding fine-structure lines from (\feii$^*$, \SIii$^*$,
\oi$^*$, \oi$^**$, \cii$^*$), securely anchoring the redshift of the host.

\subsection{GRB121024A (z = 2.300)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
13890\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13890.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{Friis2015}. Also rapid, starting 1.8 hours after the \textit{Swift}
trigger, a bright afterglow continuum is visible across all arms. A broad
absorption feature from Lyman alpha, along with narrow lines from \civ, \SIii,
\SIiv, \feii, \sii, and \alii, as well as fine-structure lines associated with
\SIii$^*$ are all detected at $z = 2.300$, securely setting it as the redshift
of the GRB.

\subsection{GRB121027A (z = 1.773)}		
The data presented here has formed the basis of GCN \#
13930\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/13930.gcn3}}, but is not
published otherwise. Starting 69.6 hours after the GRB trigger, that we detect
the afterglow continuum a so high significance in all arms with 8.4 ks
integration, testifies to the brightness of this burst. The concurrent
identification of emission lines from \oiii~and absorption from \civ, \alii,
\aliii, \mgi, \mgii, and \feii, tightly constrains the redshift of the burst to
be $(z = 1.773$

\subsection{GRB130408A (z = 3.758)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
14365\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14365.gcn3}}. The spectrum
has not otherwise been published previously. The observations consists of two
600sec spectra taken 1.9hrs after the burst. We detect absorption features from
a wide range of ions. We also detect intervening absorption at $z=1.255$ and
$z=3.248$.

\subsection{GRB130606A (z = 5.913)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
14816\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/14816.gcn3}} and is published
in \citet{Hartoog2015}. The observations consists of three 2x600sec visits
starting 7.1 hrs after the burst at fairly high airmass. We detect absorption
features from a wide range of ions at $z=5.913$ as well as intervening
absorption at $z=2.3103, 2.5207, 3.4515, 4.4660, 4.5309, 4.5427, 4.6497 $ and $
4.7244$.

\subsection{GRB151021A (z = 2.330)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
18426\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/18982.gcn3}} and is not
published elsewhere. The observation was carried out in RRM starting 44 minutes
after the GRB trigger. We detect absorption features from a wide range of ions
at $z=2.330$ as well as intervening absorption at $z=1.49$.

\subsection{GRB160203A (z = 3.517)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
18982\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/18982.gcn3}} and is not
published elsewhere. The observation was carried out in RRM starting 18 minutes
after the GRB trigger. We detect absorption features from a wide range of ions
at $z=3.517$ as well as intervening absorption at $z=2.203$.

\subsection{GRB160804A (z = 0.736)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
19773\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/19773.gcn3}}, but is not
published elsewhere. Observations started 22.37 hours after the BAT trigger and
lasted for 2.4ks. The afterglow continuum is detected across the entire
spectral coverage of X-shooter and absorption lines from \mgi, \mgii, \feii~and
\alii~are found at $z = 0.736$. At the same redshift, emission lines from \oii,
\oiii, \ha, \hb, \hg, \nii, \sii, \siii~are found. A second epoch, lasting
3.6ks, is obtained after the afterglow has faded, confirming the emission line
detections.

\subsection{GRB161007A (z =4.6 ??? NEW!!!)}
This data has not been published elsewhere. Observations for GRB161007A started
323 hours after the burst trigger and contains the potential host. 4 x 600 seconds
of observations reveals a faint continuum rising abruptly above the noise at
$\sim$ 6850 \AA~and continuing through 21000 \AA. A very low significance
continuum is detected at shorter wavelengths, down to $\sim$ 6000 \AA. If the
host is located at $z \sim 4.6$, the drop in continuum flux is the Lyman alpha
break and the absence of nebular emission lines is due to \oii being shifted
out of the wavelength coverage. Alternatively, an early-type host at $z = 0.71$
could exhibit the 4000 \AA break at 6000 \AA, but due to the preference of
long-duration GRBs for star-forming galaxies, this is the least likely
explanation, why we believe the high-z solution.

\subsection{GRB161014A (z =2.823)}
The data presented here also formed the basis of GCN \#
20061\footnote{\url{http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/20061.gcn3}}, but is not
published elsewhere. Starting 11.6 hours after the GRB trigger, 4.8 ks of
integration time captures the afterglow continuum across all three
spectroscopic arms. A broad absorption trough due to Lyman alpha is visible,
along with metal absorption features from \mgii, \SIii, \cii, \civ, \alii,
\aliii, and	\feii, all at $z =2.823$. Similar to GRB140506 \citep{Fynbo2014}, a
break in the continuum shape is detected bluewards of 6000\AA, possible
signifying some anomalous form of extinction.

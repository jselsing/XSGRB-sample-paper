abstract = {GRB 100418A was an intermediate duration GRB detected by Swift. It showed an initially dim optical afterglow that had a late increase in brightness, reaching its maximum several hours after the burst onset, unlike typical afterglows that peak tens of seconds after. It also displayed a bright X-ray and radio counterpart. In this paper we present the observations of the afterglow obtained with X-shooter. Three epochs were obtained, 0.4, 1.4, and 2.4 days after the burst. In these spectra, each covering the range from 3000 to 24800 A, we detect abundant absorption features with 4 velocity components, and emission lines from the host galaxy with 2 additional velocity components. In one single velocity component, we detect a Fe II* 2396 angstrom fine structure feature which disappears from the first to the second epoch indicating that it is due to the effect of the GRB radiation on its environment. We consider it to be the closest absorption component to the GRB itself, for which we determine a redshift of z = 0.6239 +/- 0.0002. From the H alpha to [N II] ratio we determine a host galaxy metallicity of 0.5 solar. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH{\&}Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

abstract = {For Gamma-Ray Burst 100901A, we have obtained Gemini-North and Very Large Telescope optical afterglow spectra at four epochs: one hour, one day, three days and one week after the burst, thanks to the afterglow remaining unusually bright at late times. Apart from a wealth of metal resonance lines, we also detect lines arising from fine-structure levels of the ground state of Fe II, and from metastable levels of Fe II and Ni II at the host redshift (z = 1.4084). These lines are found to vary significantly in time. The combination of the data and modelling results shows that we detect the fall of the Ni II 4 F9/2 metastable level population, which to date has not been observed. Assuming that the population of the excited states is due to the UV-radiation of the afterglow, we estimate an absorber distance of a few hundred pc. This appears to be a typical value when compared to similar studies. We detect two intervening absorbers (z = 1.3147, 1.3179). Despite the wide temporal range of the data, we do not see significant variation in the absorption lines of these two intervening systems.},

abstract = {Cont e x t . At low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been discovered with luminosities that are substantially lower (Liso {\textless} ∼ 1048.5 erg s−1) than the average of more distant ones (Liso {\textgreater} ∼ 1049.5 erg s−1). It has been suggested that the properties of several low-luminosity (low-L) GRBs are due to shock break-out, as opposed to the emission from ultrarelativistic jets. This has led to much debate about how the populations are connected. Ai Liso ∼ 1049.6−49.9 erg s−1 that have been detected up to now.With the robust detection of its accompanying supernova SN2012bz, it has the potential ms . The burst at redshift z = 0.283 from 2012 April 22 is one of the very few examples of intermediate-L GRBs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of Met to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-L GRBs and the GRB-SN connection. hods . We carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium- and low-resolution spectrographs with 6–10-m class telescopes, which covered a time span of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign, which ranged from radio to X-ray energies over a duration of ∼270 days. Furthermore, we used a tuneable filter that is centred at H$\alpha$ to map star-formation in the host and the surrounding galaxies.We used these data to extract and model the properties of different radiation components and fitted the spectral energy distribution to extract the properties of the host Resul galaxy. t s . Modelling the light curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the X-rays revealed that the blast wave expanded with an initial Lorentz factor of $\Gamma$0 ∼ 50, which is a low value in comparison to high-L GRBs, and that the afterglow had an exceptionally low peak luminosity density of {\textless} ∼2 × 1030 erg s−1 Hz−1 in the sub-mm. Because of the weak afterglow component, we were able to recover the signature of a shock break-out in an event that was not a genuine low-L GRB for the first time. At 1.4 hr after the burst, the stellar envelope had a blackbody temperature of kBT ∼ 16 eV and a radius of ∼7 × 1013 cm (both in the observer frame). The accompanying SN 2012bz reached a peak luminosity of MV = −19.7 mag, which is 0.3 mag more luminous than SN 1998bw. The synthesised nickel mass of 0.58 M?, ejecta mass of 5.87 M?,and kinetic energy of 4.10×1052 ergwere among the highest forGRB-SNe,whichmakes it themost luminous spectroscopically confirmed SNto date. Nebular emission lines at the GRB location were visible, which extend from the galaxy nucleus to the explosion site. The host and the explosion Concl site had close-to-solar metallicity. The burst occurred in an isolated star-forming region with an SFR that is 1/10 of that in the galaxy's nucleus. u si ons . While the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission points to a high-L GRB, the weak afterglow and the low $\Gamma$0 were very atypical for such a burst. Moreover, the detection of the shock break-out signature is a new quality for high-L GRBs. So far, shock break-outs were exclusively detected for low-L GRBs, while GRB 120422A had an intermediate Liso of ∼1049.6−49.9 erg s−1. Therefore, we conclude that GRB 120422A was a transition object between low- and high-L GRBs, which supports the failed-jet model that connects low-L GRBs that are driven by shock break-outs and high-L GRBs that are powered by ultra-relativistic jets},

abstract = {(Abridged). We present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (OAs) of Swift detected GRBs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured. We provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward of Ly-alpha. We discuss to what extent the current sample of Swift bursts with OA spectroscopy is a biased subsample of all Swift detected GRBs. For that purpose we define an X-ray selected sample of Swift bursts with optimal conditions for ground-based follow up from the period March 2005 to September 2008; 146 bursts fulfill our sample criteria. We derive the redshift distribution for this sample and conclude that less than 19{\%} of Swift bursts are at z{\textgreater}7. We compare the high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i) bursts with redshifts measured from OA spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detected OA, but no OA-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the OA. The bursts in group i) have significantly less excess X-ray absorption than bursts in the other two groups. In addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14{\%} in group i), 38{\%} in group ii) and {\textgreater} 39{\%} in group iii). From this we conclude that the sample of GRBs with OA spectroscopy is not representative for all Swift bursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. Finally, we characterize GRB absorption systems as a class and compare them to QSO absorption systems, in particular DLAs. On average GRB absorbers are characterized by significantly stronger EWs for HI as well as for both low and high ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening QSO absorbers. Based on the z{\textgreater}2 bursts in the sample we place a 95{\%} confidence upper limit of 7.5{\%} on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {We perform a detailed study of the gamma-ray burst GRB 091127/SN 2009nz host galaxy at z = 0.490 using the VLT/X-shooter spectrograph in slit and integral-field unit (IFU) mode. From the analysis of the optical and X-ray afterglow data obtained from ground-based telescopes and Swift-XRT, we confirm the presence of a bump associated with SN 2009nz and find evidence of a possible jet break in the afterglow lightcurve. The X-shooter afterglow spectra reveal several emission lines from the underlying host, from which we derive its integrated properties. These properties agree with those of previously studied GRB-SN hosts and, more generally, with those of the long GRB host population. We use the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based images of the host to determine its stellar mass (M{\_}{\{}⋆{\}}). Our results extend to lower M{\_}{\{}⋆{\}} values the M-Z plot derived for the sample of long GRB hosts at 0.3 {\{}$\backslash$lt{\}} z {\{}$\backslash$lt{\}} 1.0 adding new information to probe the faint end of the M-Z relation and the shift of the LGRB host M-Z relation from that found from emission-line galaxy surveys. Thanks to the IFU spectroscopy, we can build the two-dimensional (2D) velocity, velocity dispersion, and star formation rate (SFR) maps. They show that the host galaxy has perturbed rotation kinematics with evidence of a SFR enhancement consistent with the afterglow position.

@article{Wiersema2012,
abstract = {[Abridged] A number of phenomena have been observed in GRB afterglows that defy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading to a variety of new models. Polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic of afterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structure of the GRB jets. In this paper we present the first high quality multi-night polarimetric light curve of a Swift GRB afterglow, aimed at providing a well calibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system for modelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. In particular, our dataset of the afterglow of GRB 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linear polarimetry (R band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (R band) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (Ks band). We add to that high quality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. The linear polarisation varies between 0 and 3{\%}, with both long and short time scale variability visible. We find an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds to features in the polarimetric curve. We find that the data can be reproduced by jet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature is present in the polarimetric curve. We probe the ordered magnetic field component in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, finding P{\_}circ {\textless} 0.15{\%} (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a GRB afterglow, suggesting ordered fields are weak, if at all present. Our simultaneous R and Ks band polarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likely negligible.},

abstract = {Abundances of galaxies at redshifts z {\textgreater} 4 are difficult to obtain from damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) systems in the sightlines of quasars (QSOs) due to the Ly$\alpha$ forest blanketing and the low number of high-redshift QSOs known to date. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with their higher luminosity are well suited to study galaxies out to the formation of the first stars at z {\textgreater} 10. The large wavelength coverage of the X-shooter spectrograph makes it an excellent tool to study the interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, in particular if the redshift is not known beforehand. In this paper, we determine the properties of a GRB host at z = 4.667 23 from absorption lines combined with X-ray and optical imaging data. This is one of the highest redshifts where a detailed analysis with medium-resolution data is possible. We measure a relatively high metallicity of [S/H] = -1.1 ± 0.2 for a galaxy at this redshift. Assuming ultraviolet pumping as origin for the fine-structure lines, the material observed is between 0.3 and 1.0 kpc from the GRB. The extinction determined by the spectral slope from X-rays to the infrared shows a moderate value of AV = 0.13 ± 0.05 mag and relative abundances point to a warm disc extinction pattern. Low- and high-ionization as well as fine-structure lines show a complicated kinematic structure probably pointing to a merger in progress. We also detect one intervening system at z = 2.18. GRB-DLAs have a shallower evolution of metallicity with redshift than QSO absorbers and no evolution in their H i column density or ionization fraction. GRB hosts at high redshifts seem to continue the trend of the metallicity-luminosity relation towards lower metallicities but the sample is still too small to draw a definite conclusion. While the detection of GRBs at z {\textgreater} 4 with current satellites is still difficult, they are very important for our understanding of the early epochs of star and galaxy formation.},

Methods: We analyzed medium-resolution, multi-epoch spectroscopic observations (R {\~{}} 7000-12 000, corresponding to {\~{}}15-23 km s-1, S/N = 15-30 and wavelength range 3000-25 000 {\AA}) of the optical afterglow of GRB 120327A, taken with X-shooter at the VLT 2.13 and 27.65 hr after the GRB trigger. Results: The first epoch spectrum shows that the ISM in the GRB host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich in absorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles. The hydrogen column density associated with GRB 120327A has log NH/cm-2 = 22.01 ± 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [X/H] = -1.3 to -1.1. In addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorption features associated with excited states of C ii, O i, Si ii, Fe ii, and Ni ii, which we used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of the GRB explosion. The variability of the Fe ii$\lambda$2396 excited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited by the GRB UV flux. Moreover, the distance of component I is found to be dI = 200+100-60 pc, while component II is located closer to the GRB, at dII = 100+40-30 pc. These values are among the lowest found in GRBs. Component III does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther away from the GRB. The presence of H2 molecules is firmly established, with a molecular fraction f in the range f = 4 × 10-7-10-4. This particularly low value can be attributed to the small dust content. This represents the third positive detection of molecules in a GRB environment.

abstract = {We present the first reported case of the simultaneous metallicity determination of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy, from both afterglow absorption lines as well as strong emission-line diagnostics. Using spectroscopic and imaging observations of the afterglow and host of the long-duration GRB121024A at z = 2.30, we give one of the most complete views of a GRB host/environment to date. We observe a strong damped Ly-alpha absorber (DLA) with a hydrogen column density of log N(HI) = 21.80+/-0.15, H{\_}2 absorption in the Lyman-Werner bands (molecular fraction of log(f) {\~{}} -1.4; fourth solid detection of molecular hydrogen in a GRB-DLA), the nebular emission lines H-alpha, H-beta, [OII], [OIII] and [NII], as well as a large variety of metal absorption lines. We find a GRB host galaxy that is highly star-forming (SFR {\~{}} 40 Msolar/yr), with a dust-corrected metallicity along the line of sight of [Zn/H]corr = -0.5+/-0.2 ([O/H] {\~{}} -0.3 from emission lines), and a depletion factor of refractory elements of [Zn/Fe] = 0.85+/-0.04. The molecular gas is separated by 400 km/s from the gas that is excited by the GRB (implying a fairly massive host, in agreement with the derived stellar mass of log(Mstellar/Msolar) = 9.9+/-0.2). Including emission line analysis, we isolate and characterise three different gas-phases within the star-forming host galaxy. Our main result is that the metallicity determinations from both absorption and emission lines are consistent, which is encouraging for the comparison of GRB host metallicities at different redshifts.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (H{\_}2), including the presence of vibrationally-excited H{\_}2{\^{}}* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of GRB 120815A at z=2.36 obtained with X-shooter at the VLT. Simultaneous photometric broad-band data from GROND and X-ray observations by Swift/XRT place further constraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. The galactic environment of GRB 120815A is characterized by a strong DLA with log(N(H)/cm{\^{}}-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent H{\_}2 absorption in the Lyman-Werner bands (log(N(H{\_}2)/cm{\^{}}-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fraction log f(H{\_}2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. The distance d between the absorbing neutral gas and GRB 120815A is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure and meta-stable transitions of FeII and NiII to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. The DLA metallicity ([Zn/H] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (A{\_}V {\{}$\backslash$lt{\}} 0.15 mag) and dust depletion ([Zn/Fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values of well-studied, H{\_}2-deficient GRB-DLAs observed at high spectral resolution, and the approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and H{\_}2-rich GRB 080607 sightline. With respect to N(H), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction and depletion, GRB 120815A is fairly representative of the average properties of GRB-DLAs. This demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least a fraction of the more typical GRB-DLAs, and H{\_}2 and H{\_}2{\^{}}* are probably more wide-spread among GRB-selected systems than the few examples of previous detections would suggest.},

abstract = {Context. X-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to become operative at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). It is a broad-band medium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectroscopy as one of its main science drivers. Aims. During the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fully assembled, X-shooter observed the afterglow of GRB 090313 as a demonstration of the instrument's capabilities. Methods. GRB 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, when the object had already faded to R{\~{}}21.6. Furthermore, the 90{\%} illuminated Moon was just 30 degrees away from the field. In spite of the adverse conditions, we obtained a spectrum that, for the first time in GRB research, covers simultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 Angstroms. Results. The spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of 3.3736, the redshift of the GRB. These features are composed of 3 components with different ionisation levels and velocities. Some of the features have never been observed before in a GRB at such a high redshift. Furthermore, we detect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597. Conclusions. These results demonstrate the potential of X-shooter in the GRB field, as it was capable of observing a GRB down to a magnitude limit that would include 72{\%} of long GRB afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. Coupled with the rapid response mode available at VLT, allowing reaction times of just a few minutes, X-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on medium resolution spectroscopic studies of GRBs, their host galaxies and intervening systems, probing the early history of the Universe.},

abstract = {We report on the spectroscopic detection of supernova SN 2010ma associated with the long gamma-ray burst GRB 101219B. We observed the optical counterpart of the GRB on three nights with the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. From weak absorption lines, we measure a redshift of z = 0.55. The first-epoch UV-near-infrared afterglow spectrum, taken 11.6 hr after the burst, is well fit by a power law consistent with the slope of the X-ray spectrum. The second- and third-epoch spectra (obtained 16.4 and 36.7 days after the burst), however, display clear bumps closely resembling those of the broad-lined type-Ic SN 1998bw if placed at z = 0.55. Apart from demonstrating that spectroscopic SN signatures can be observed for GRBs at these large distances, our discovery makes a step forward in establishing a general connection between GRBs and SNe. In fact, unlike most previous unambiguous GRB-associated SNe, GRB 101219B has a large gamma-ray energy (E iso = 4.2 × 1051 erg), a bright afterglow, and obeys the "Amati" relation, thus being fully consistent with the cosmological population of GRBs.
